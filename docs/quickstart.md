# Quickstart Guide

## Requirements

Install [pipx]:

```console
python -m pip install --user pipx
python -m pipx ensurepath
```

Install [cruft]:

```console
pipx install cruft[pyproject]
```

Install [Nox]:

```console
pipx install nox
```

Install [uv]:

```console
pipx install uv
```

[pipx] is preferred, but you can also install with `pip install --user`.

With uv installed, fetch the Python toolchains you need. For example:

```console
uv python install 3.13
uv python install 3.12
uv python install 3.11
uv python install 3.10
```

uv will automatically pick up these interpreters when you run Nox sessions or `uv sync`.

## Creating a project

Generate a Python project:

```console
cruft create https://github.com/statisticsnorway/ssb-pypitemplate.git --checkout=2025.7.18
```

Cruft downloads the template and asks you a series of questions about project variables.
Further details can be found in the [Creating a project] section of the user guide.

Change to the root directory of your new project,
and create a Git repository:

```console
git init
git add .
git commit
```

### Install the environment and create a lock-file

Install the development environment and create the lock file:

```console
uv sync
git add uv.lock
git commit
```

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```console
nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
nox --list-sessions
```

Install the pre-commit hooks:

```console
nox -s pre-commit -- install
```

If you want to run the tests with a non-default python version:

```console
nox --force-python 3.13
```

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub

1. Sign up at [GitHub].
2. Create an empty repository for your project.
3. Follow the instructions to push an existing repository from the command line.

### PyPI

1. Sign up at [PyPI].
2. Go to the Account Settings on PyPI, select Publishing,
   and set up a new pending publisher as described on
   [Creating a PyPI Project with a Trusted Publisher][trusted publisher].
3. Use the following information for the new pending publisher:
   - PyPI Project name: Name of the GitHub repo.
   - Owner: GitHub organization name or GitHub username that owns the repository.
   - Repository name: Name of the GitHub repo.
   - Workflow name: `release.yml`
   - Environment: Leave empty.

### TestPyPI

1. Sign up at [TestPyPI].
2. Go to the Account Settings on TestPyPI, select Publishing,
   and set up a new pending publisher as described on
   [Creating a PyPI Project with a Trusted Publisher][trusted publisher].
3. Use the following information for the new pending publisher:
   - PyPI Project name: Name of the GitHub repo.
   - Owner: GitHub organization name or GitHub username that owns the repository.
   - Repository name: Name of the GitHub repo.
   - Workflow name: `release.yml`
   - Environment: Leave empty.

### Read the Docs

1. Sign in to [Read the Docs] with your GitHub account.
2. Import your repository using the _Import a Project_ workflow.
3. Select the template-generated repository and accept the defaults.
4. Trigger the first build from the Read the Docs dashboard.

Documentation will then be available at `https://<project>.readthedocs.io/`.

### Codecov

1. Sign in to [Codecov] with your GitHub account.
2. Add the repository generated from this template.
3. (Optional) create a repository secret named `CODECOV_TOKEN` if the project is private.
4. Merge a pull request to upload coverage data automatically from GitHub Actions.

## Releasing

Releases are triggered by a version bump on the default branch.
It is recommended to do this in a separate pull request:

1. Switch to a branch.
2. Bump the version using `uv version --bump patch`.
3. Commit and push to GitHub.
4. Open a pull request.
5. Merge the pull request.

The Release workflow performs the following automated steps:

- Build and upload the package to PyPI.
- Apply a version tag to the repository.
- Publish a GitHub Release.

Release notes are populated with the titles and authors of merged pull requests.
You can group the pull requests into separate sections
by applying labels to them, like this:

<!-- table-release-drafter-sections-begin -->

| Pull Request Label | Section in Release Notes     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `breaking`         | üí• Breaking Changes          |
| `enhancement`      | üöÄ Features                  |
